# CHISim

## Repository for SC2021 ACM Student Research Competition.

CHISim is a data-driven simulator developed for evaluating the strategies of co-locating Chameleon Cloud with High Throughput Computing(HTC) workloads. CHISim replicates the components and processing logic of the OpenStack Blazar, the Chameleon resource manager. This Jupyter Notebook illustrates how to set up the experimental environment (create and configure a bare-metal instance using the Blazar API and Ansible scripts) for the CHISim simulator and run experiments.
